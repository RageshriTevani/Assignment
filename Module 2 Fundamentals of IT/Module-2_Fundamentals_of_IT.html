2.What is Hosting?
<!--
    Web hosting is the process of storing and making web pages or websites accessible on the internet. 

    To make a website available to the public on the internet, HTML files and associated assets (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts) need to be stored on a server. This server is part of a web hosting service.

    The following steps take place when a user tries to visit a website housed on a hosting provider's web server:

    1)A user enters the URL or domain name of the website into a web browser.
    
    2)The browser translates the domain name into an IP address and    sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or HTTP Secure (HTTPS) request to the web server renting the website space.
    
    3)In response to the request, the web server locates the resources and transfers the files needed to load the requested web page into the user's web browser.
