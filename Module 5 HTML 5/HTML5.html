2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
<!--
In HTML5, you can embed audio and video using the <audio> and <video> elements, respectively. Here's a basic example for each:

Embedding Audio:

    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>

In this example:
    The controls attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.).
    The <source> element specifies the audio file (audio.mp3) and its type.


Embedding Video:
    <video controls width="600">
        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
  n</video>

In this video example:

    The controls attribute adds playback controls.

    The width attribute sets the width of the video player.

    The <source> element specifies the video file (video.mp4) and its type.

3. Semantic element in HTML5?
<!--
Semantic elements in HTML5 are tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of a web page. They provide a more descriptive and meaningful way to structure a document, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the purpose of different parts of the page. Here are some key semantic elements introduced in HTML5:

Examples of semantic elements:
 <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Here are some more key semantic elements introduced in HTML5:

4. Canvas and SVG tags
<!--
Both the <canvas> and <svg> tags are used in HTML to create graphics and visual elements on a webpage, but they have different approaches and use cases.

<canvas> Tag:

    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

    The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
    
    Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

    Ex>:

    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
    </canvas>

<SVG> Tag:

    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics

    SVG is used to define graphics for the Web

    The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.


    
    Ex.:

    <svg width="100" height="100">
         <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
    </svg>
